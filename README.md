**A Django-based web application for managing software.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This project is a Django web application designed for managing software information.  It provides a platform to list, categorize, and potentially manage different software applications.  The current implementation appears to be a basic structure, possibly a work in progress.  Further details on specific features are limited due to the incomplete nature of the provided codebase.

## ✨ Features (Based on Current Structure)

- **Software Listing:**  The application is structured to support the listing of software, potentially with details and categorization.
- **Admin Panel (Likely):** The presence of an `AdminPage` directory suggests an admin interface for managing the software database.
- **Deployment Script:** A `deploy.sh` script indicates a focus on deployment automation.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue)](https://www.python.org/)

**Database:** (Requires further investigation of the codebase to confirm the specific database used)
- TODO: Add database badge


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (version specified in requirements.txt)
- A database server (requires confirmation from the codebase -  PostgreSQL is a likely candidate given Django's default settings, but this needs verification)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvir-yzu/software_portal.git
   cd software_portal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   TODO: Provide database setup commands (e.g., creating the database, running migrations).  This requires inspection of the Django `settings.py` file and the models.


4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or the port specified during server startup).

## ⚙️ Configuration

TODO:  Information on configuration options requires inspection of `settings.py` and any other configuration files.

## 🧪 Testing

TODO: Test setup details require code review to detect the chosen framework and commands.

## 🚀 Deployment

The `deploy.sh` script suggests an automated deployment process.  However, detailed instructions require examining the script itself.

TODO: Add deployment instructions based on `deploy.sh` content.
